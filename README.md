# Project - Selenium + Cucumber (QA)

In this test, the following dependencies were used:

* JUNIT
* HAMCREST
* SELENIUM
* CUCUMBER

Initially, 2 tests were created using Page Objects and the Junit nomenclature in the HomePageTests class. I divided the screens into classes, the tests in another class, and the start and end of the tests in the Base class.

I then used the Cucumber vocabulary and created a scenario with 4 steps. The test is in features and the steps are in the BuscaProdutosSteps class.
